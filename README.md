# ‚ö° Utility Bill Extraction System

A lightweight Node.js backend utility for extracting structured data from utility bill PDFs (e.g., TNB) using **PDF.js** and **coordinate-based text mapping**.  
This project converts raw bill PDFs into clean, JSON-ready outputs that can be integrated with automation tools such as **n8n**, **Supabase**, or internal APIs.

## üß© Overview

This project automates utility bill processing by:
1. Loading PDF files via **PDF.js**.
2. Mapping key data fields (like `Account No`, `Bill Date`, `Total Amount`) using **defined coordinate boxes**.
3. Extracting text directly from the visual layout.
4. Returning parsed JSON objects ready for storage or further automation.
